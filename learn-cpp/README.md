# I wanna learn C++

C++ is a general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1979. It's an extension of the C programming language with object-oriented programming capabilities, hence the name "C with Classes" which later became C++.

## Key Advantages of C++

### 1. **Performance & Speed**

- **Compiled Language**: C++ is compiled to machine code, making it extremely fast
- **Low-level Control**: Direct memory management and hardware access
- **Zero-cost Abstractions**: High-level features don't sacrifice performance
- **Ideal for**: Game engines, operating systems, embedded systems, high-frequency trading

### 2. **Memory Management**

- **Manual Control**: You decide when and how to allocate/deallocate memory
- **Predictable Performance**: No garbage collector causing unexpected pauses
- **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**: Automatic resource management through destructors

### 3. **Multi-paradigm**

- **Object-Oriented**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- **Procedural**: Functions and structured programming
- **Generic**: Templates for type-safe code reuse
- **Functional**: Lambda expressions, function objects

### 4. **Rich Standard Library**

- **STL (Standard Template Library)**: Containers, algorithms, iterators
- **Comprehensive**: String handling, file I/O, threading, networking
